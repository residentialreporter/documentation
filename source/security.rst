Submitting Security Vulnerabilities
===================================

We welcome all vulnerability reports. We do however prefer vulnerability reports
in a clear and concise form with repeatable steps. One of the best ways you can
report a bug to us is by writing a unit test (//similar to the ones in our tests//)
so that we can verify the vulnerability, fix it and commit the fix along with
the test.

To submit a vulnerability report, please `Create an Issue`_
