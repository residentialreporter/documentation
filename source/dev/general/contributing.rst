Contributing to ResidentialReporter
===================================

Here's how you can contribute to ResidentialReporter

Submitting Bug Reports
----------------------

We welcome all bug reports. We do however prefer bug reports in a clear
and concise form with repeatable steps. One of the best ways you can report
a bug to us is by writing a unit test (//similar to the ones in our tests//)
so that we can verify the bug, fix it and commit the fix along with the test.

To submit a bug report, please `Create an Issue`_

Writing new tests
-----------------

We're not perfect, and we're still writing more tests to ensure quality code.
If you'd like to help, please `Fork ResidentialReporter`_, write more tests that cover more
of our code base and submit a `Pull Request`_. Many Thanks!

Adding New Features
-------------------

If you'd like to see a new feature added to ResidentialReporter, then we'd like to hear
about it~ We would like to see some discussion around any new features as well
as valid use-cases. To start the discussions off, please either:

- `Create an Issue`_

Writing Documentation
---------------------

.. _contribute_docs:

We'd love to get your assistance and help with writing and translating
documentation. We use sphinx which integrates nicely into the ResidentialReporter project
concepts, but you don't necessarily need to delve into it that deep.

Even writing descriptive/explanatory texts and maybe supplying screenshots for
functionality is welcome.

.. note::

    We plan to automate the screenshot functionality, so updating docs is less
    work.
