Development Introduction
========================


Here's how we aim to do things in the ResidentialReporter project development.

If you're looking for instructions on how to set up a development environment,
please check out :ref:`the workflow documentation <environment>`.

Communication
-------------

- `ResidentialReporter Gitter`_
- `Issue Tracker`_ located at `https://github.com/residentialreporter/residentialreporter/issues`

Standards
---------

We use the following coding standard:

- `PEP-008 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_

(Actually, we're transitioning to black)

We also lint our codebase with the following tools:

- `pyflakes <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes>`_
- `pep8 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8>`_
- `mccabe <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mccabe/0.2.1>`_

Please ensure your Development IDE or Editor has the above
linters and checkers in place and enabled.

Alternatively you can use the following command line tool:

- `flake8 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8>`_


Tools
-----

We use the following tools to develop the ResidentialReporter project and share code:

- **Code Sharing:**
  `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_
- **Code Hosting and Bug Reporting:**
  `GitHub <https://github.com/residentialreporter/residentialreporter>`_
- **Issue Tracker:**
  `Issue Tracker <https://github.com/residentialreporter/residentialreporter/issues>`_
- **Documentation Hosting:**
  `Read the Docs <http://residentialreporter.readthedocs.org>`_

We strongly suggest familiarizing with all of them, to make sure you understand
our CI.

Big thanks to all of these magnificent and free-for-opensource services!
