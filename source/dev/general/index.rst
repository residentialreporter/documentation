How to help the project?
========================

Sorry, this section is not translated to german yet. `Please help out! <_translate>`_

Glad to see you're interested in helping out the project!

Generally, you can `ping TBD <tbd@no-such-mail.notld>`__ or `ping riot <riot@c-base.org>`__ if you want to help
out and don't exactly know where to start.

Here, we list some possible opportunities where you can help us and become
part of the driving community:

Communication
-------------

People need to be more aware of this project as it may be of great value to
them. If you're interested in spreading the word and getting people involved,
you're very welcome to do so!

Testing
-------

.. attention::

    We're in the process of bringing everything online, but right now, the backend
    is still missing. We hope to get a development/demo server ready ASAP.

    Until that is done, testing is rather limited.

There are various degrees to which you can test the project:

  - Check the installation processes if they actually work on your platform and
    everything installs smoothly
  - Test-drive your installation or the `demo instance
    <https://residentialreporter.github.io/residentialreporter-frontend/index.html>`__
  - Build and extend parts of the automatic testing infrastructure
  - Optimize and extend the continuous integration infrastructure

User Experience
---------------

We'd value your input on some very important user experience questions:

  - Is the current design logical and does it allow for a smooth
    user experience?
  - Check the supplied modules and the framework itself for consistency and
    good UX practices
  - Develop further use cases and user stories to spark new modules

Documentation
-------------

A lot of documentation is still missing. If you're interested in writing
documentation, you should be familiar with the two core tools we use for
generating our documentation:

  - `reStructured Text formatting
    <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`__
  - `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html>`__

We still need a lot of documentation, so there's ample opportunities in this
field.

Translations
------------

Currently, translation is handled by manually editing files and most of them
are in the frontend. We plan to provide better support (e.g. Transifex collaboration)
but that might take some more time.

See https://github.com/residentialreporter/residentialreporter-frontend/tree/master/src/assets/i18n
for more details.


Developer Guidelines
====================

This is the rather dry material for new software developers:
